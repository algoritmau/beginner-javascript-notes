> Living Document â€“ Last Edited 1 Jul 2020

Hi, there. I'm [Mauricio Paternina](https://linkedin.com/in/mauriciopaterninar), a UX Designer from Colombia, seeking to become a Software Developer. You can find me on any social media as **@spaceinvadev**.

These are my notes and extended observations on the [Beginner JavaScript](https://beginnerjavascript.com/) course by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/). Keep in mind that the content, as well as the order of these notes, might differ from what's explained on the course as I gathered additional information from other sources to complement and enrich the knowledge.

You can read the full notes [here](https://www.notion.so/Beginner-JavaScript-Notes-ea3c6d5a6de54c658435f4d894232b74).
